          <strong><em>Audrey Hepburn</em></strong> is best known for being one
          of Hollywood’s most successful actresses and for her unfaltering
          beauty as a model. Her elegance and grace made her a worldwide style
          icon, and she still remains so today. However, little do we hear of
          her efforts as a philanthropist. Audrey lived by the philosophy of
          putting others before herself; ultimately she became a Goodwill
          Ambassador for UNICEF in 1988, devoting the rest of her life to the
          organisation. Born on <strong>4th May 1929</strong> in Brussels,
          Belgium, Audrey enjoyed a privileged childhood; travelling from
          Belgium, to the Netherlands, to England. After her father, Joseph
          Victor Hepburn-Ruston, abruptly left her mother, Ella van Heemstra,
          the mother and daughter settled in Kent, England in 1937. During the
          Second World War, the pair relocated to the Netherlands, where Audrey
          flourished as a ballet dancer despite the oppressive conditions from
          living under Nazi rule. She made her stage debut in the musical High
          Button Shoes in London, and made her film debut in the same year, in
          Dutch in Seven Lessons. Audrey supported her career by working
          part-time as a model, through which she was increasingly recognised by
          film producers. After little success in England, Audrey left to pursue
          the American Dream and swiftly gained prominence there due to her star
          performance in Roman Holiday. The film was an enormous success,
          winning her an Oscar for Best Actress. Her performance in Sabrina
          earned her an Academy Award Nomination, and for Ondine, she was
          awarded the Tony Award for Best Actress. She starred alongside her
          husband Mel Ferrer in War and Peace, showcased her dancing abilities
          in the musical Funny Face, and acted in The Nun’s Story, earning her
          another Academy Award nomination. But Audrey reached the peak of her
          career in her performance as Holly Golightly in Breakfast at
          Tiffany’s, where she became one of the most iconic characters in 20th
          century American cinema, setting new standards for glamour and
          fashion. For this she received her third Academy Award nomination.
